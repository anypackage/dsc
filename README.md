## Known Issues

### DSC Resources Not Found

The `AnyPackageDsc` or `AnyPackage` module has to be imported before `Get-DscResource` or `Invoke-DscResource` will find the resource.
`AnyPackageDsc` requires types in `AnyPackage` and is most likely the issue with how `PSDesiredStateConfiguration` finds resources.
An issue has been logged and you can follow PowerShell/PSDesiredStateConfiguration#104 for updates.
